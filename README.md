This is an e-commerce website project I developed to practice and learn JavaScript, PHP, JSON, and MySQL.

What I Worked On: 
JavaScript
I used JavaScript to make the website interactive. For example: Handling the "Place Order" button when users want to order something or making parts of the page update without needing a full page refresh.

PHP: 
PHP is used on the server side to manage stuff like: User login and signup forms, Connecting to the database to check if the user exists, and if not, adding them. User passwords were hidden by hashing so that anyone with access to the database cannot see that sensitive info.

MySQL: 
I used MySQL for the database, where I store things like: User information (for logging in and signing up). 
Product details (like the name, price, and image of the jerseys).
Order details, table constraints were implemented as well.

JSON: 
I used JSON to send and receive data between the client (JavaScript) and the server (PHP). For example, when you place an order, the data is sent to the server in JSON format.
