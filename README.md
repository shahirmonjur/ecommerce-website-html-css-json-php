This is an e-commerce website project I developed to practice and learn JavaScript, PHP, JSON, and MySQL.

What I Worked On: 

  JavaScript: 
  I used JavaScript to make the website interactive. For example: Handling the "Place Order" button when users want to order something or making parts of the page update without needing a full page refresh.
  
  PHP: 
  
  PHP is used on the server side to manage stuff like: User login and signup forms, Connecting to the database to check if the user exists, and if not, adding them. User passwords were hidden by hashing so that anyone with access to the database cannot see that sensitive info.
  
  MySQL: 
  
  I used MySQL for the database, where I store things like: User information (for logging in and signing up). 
  Product details (like the name, price, and image of the jerseys).
  Order details, table constraints were implemented as well.
  
  JSON: 
  
  I used JSON to send and receive data between the client (JavaScript) and the server (PHP). For example, when you place an order, the data is sent to the server in JSON format.
  
HTML:

HTML is used to build the structure of the website. Some things I used it for: Creating the layout of the website, like the header, main content, and footer.
  Organizing product listings with images, names, and prices.
  Setting up forms for login, signup, and ordering products.

CSS:

CSS is used to style the website and make it look better. For example: Making the website responsive so it looks good on different screen sizes.
  Styling the buttons, fonts, and colors to give it a cleaner look.
  Arranging the product listings into grids so they are easier to browse.
